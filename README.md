Web Development Tasks

My name is Meena and I declare that all the data added to this repository is created and constructed by me.

All tasks from Oasis Infobyte's Level 2 Web development and design internship are included in this repository.

Task 1: Calculator
Using CSS, HTML, and JavaScript, you can make a calculator with simple mathematical capabilities.
To execute fundamental operations like addition, subtraction, division, and multiplication, calculators need an interactive user interface.
It has a display screen where the results of the user's input can be seen.

Task 2: Tribute Page
I made a page for someone I admire quickly and easy thanks to my basic knowledge of HTML and CSS.
Write about the person, include photographs, create a visually pleasing arrangement, and utilise suitable paragraph breaks.
Additionally, I experimented with various background colours and font styles. 

Task 3:To do List
Users of the to-do web app can add new items to lists, and these items need to be visible in order to be added to a list.
On successful completion, a user can also mark a task as "complete," and these completed tasks must show up on a different list, say Completed Tasks.
